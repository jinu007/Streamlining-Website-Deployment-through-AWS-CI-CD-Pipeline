# Streamlining Website Deployment through AWS CI/CD Pipeline

The HTML code you provided is a basic website template that includes a header, a section for service icons, and a subscribe section.

The header includes a logo, a title, and a brief description of the website. The section for service icons includes three boxes that display icons and brief descriptions for development, friendly support, and live support services. The subscribe section includes a form for users to subscribe to the website's newsletter.

The code also includes CSS for styling and JavaScript for preloading the website. Additionally, it uses the Font Awesome library for icons and the Respond.js library for compatibility with older browsers.
